          <p>I recently watched <em>The Notebook</em> for the first time (I know, do I live under a rock or what?). My review, in one breath, is that it’s as charming and honest as it is long. I don't feel the need to analyze the film here in its entirety. But there’s one scene in particular that made an impression on me, and it's not the one you're thinking of: it's the all-important Grand Gesture that makes or breaks any romance.</p>

          <p>Early in <em>The Notebook</em>, teenage Noah (Ryan Gosling) convinces his crush Allie (Rachel McAdams) to lie down with him in the middle of an empty street. He’s appalled by her nonstop college-prep schedule and asks her what she does for herself. After some thinking, she finds that the only thing she does for herself is painting.</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-4">
            <img src="/assets/lying-in-the-street.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Noah and Allie lying in the street.">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Pictured: standard first date activities.</em></figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Later, Noah takes Allie to the ruins of an ancient house and lays out his plans for how he’ll fix it up, all the way down to his woodworking shop in the barn. Allie asks whether she’s going to have a space for herself, and Noah says she can have a say if she wants one. Here they establish that the house is a symbol for Noah's future.</p>

          <p>Much later, Noah renovates the old house by himself because Allie dumped him and moved away to live in New York. Noah and Allie decide to hook up despite the fact that both of them are now in passionless and utilitarian relationships with other people. In the morning, Allie follows arrows on the floor to a room overlooking the river filled with painting supplies. Noah’s Grand Gesture states that not only will Allie have a place in his house (his future) but that he insists she do things that make her happy. As far as Grand Gestures go, this is hard to top.</p>

          <p>Let’s compare this to a seemingly similar scene in another romance, Disney’s animated classic <em>Beauty and the Beast.</em> I’m sure you know the scene I’m talking about: the Beast realizes that he’s head over heels in love with Belle and wants to do something special for her. He knows that Belle loves books, so he leads her to the castle’s library where the shelves extend all the way to a vaulted ceiling.</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-5">
            <img src="/assets/beast-library.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded big-image" alt="The enormous library from Beauty and the Beast.">
          </figure>

          <p>I have problems with this Grand Gesture. First of all, Beast doesn’t even come up with the idea&mdash;Lumiere does. Second, the library was already there. It was built by somebody else for purposes totally unrelated to Beast or Belle. Beast didn’t need to go out and acquire the books or even clean the room. He sacrifices nothing to make this happen. The library is only a surprise because Belle is a prisoner who wasn't allowed to visit certain parts of the castle.</p>

          <p>Before I rag on Beast any further, allow me to point out that there are some fundamental, functional differences between the Grand Gestures in <em>The Notebook</em> and <em>Beauty and the Beast.</em> Noah is not the protagonist, so his gesture serves to push Allie to make the right choice when she's faced with her Crisis Decision&mdash;will she live a safe life or make herself happy? Beast, on the other hand, <em>is</em> the protagonist. The importance of Beast's gesture, then, is to prove whether he himself has made progress towards his own Crisis Decision.</p>

          <p>For a fair comparison, let's look at one of my all-time favorite movies:</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-4">
            <img src="/assets/stranger-than-fiction-poster.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Movie poster for Stranger than Fiction.">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">An underwhelming poster for an excellent movie.</em></figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is auditing Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who is equal parts baker and anarchist. In one of their tentative early conversations, Ana discovers that Harold has never eaten homemade cookies and bakes some right there in front of him. Given that he’s actively auditing her, Harold says that it would be unethical to accept a gift from her. He insists on paying for the cookies. You don’t have to be an expert in seduction to know that Ana finds this insulting and it ruins the moment entirely.</p>

          <p>So how does Harold make it up to her?</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-5">
            <img src="/assets/i-brought-you-flours.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Harold gives Ana a box of flours.">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Me too, Maggie. Me too.</em></figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>That’s right, he brings the baker a bouquet of <em>flours.</em> At first glance this is a superficially cute gesture on par with the library surprise. The male lead manages to remember the single defining trait of the female lead&mdash;congrats.</p>
          
          <p>Harold's gift, however, only serves to get his foot in the door so he can make his real Grand Gesture. Ana tries to refuse by pointing out the hypocrisy&mdash;he can’t accept gifts but he can give them? Harold confirms that it's definitely unsanctioned, but he no longer cares. He wants her. The flours aren’t just a gift, they serve as proof that he's grown into a person who's willing to have a human experience in lieu of a series of statistical outcomes.</p>

          <p>In short, Harold's Grand Gesture has two parts: The thoughtful symbol (flours), and the proof of growth. The sum of Harold's experiences throughout the story have taught him that his previous actions were wrong and the Grand Gesture is how he makes that clear to Ana.</p>

          <p>Beast fails in both of these regards. We've already established that the library is only marginally thoughtful at best, and then Disney asks us to accept that the symbol alone makes a meaningful change in the relationship between Belle and Beast.</p>
          
          <p>As for proof of growth, I’ve tried to imagine a scenario where the Beast uses the library the same way Harold Crick uses the flours. He brings Belle to the library and then pulls her aside to say… what? I’m sorry that I made you stay here in exchange for your dad’s arbitrary imprisonment. Here, this obscene amount of books might take the edge off your eternity here.</p>

          <p>Okay, I know what you’re thinking. The Grand Gesture in Beauty and the Beast isn’t the library scene at all. Instead, it comes when Beast allows Belle to leave the castle of her own free will in order to care for her father. This essentially dooms Beast and all the living furniture to endure their cursed state forever. Don’t get me wrong; this is a great, ironic writing decision. Beast prioritizes someone else's needs over his one chance to lift the curse, which is itself the proof that he’s worthy of lifting the curse.</p>

          <p>So why was the library surprise necessary at all? Well, what it <em>does</em> accomplish is show that Beast has feelings for Belle. He places his hand on the wound that Belle dressed, remembering the kindness she showed, and then asks his servants how to express himself. This would have been a great opportunity for Lumiere and Cogsworth to explain what worked for Harold Crick; do something thoughtful that also demonstrates the kind of man you've become since you met her. The Beast would get frustrated and brush it off because the concept wouldn't make sense to him&mdash;until, of course, he's given the opportunity later to let Belle leave the castle.</p>

          <p>There are three things to take away from this: 1) If the Grand Gesture is made by the protagonist, it should contain both a thoughtful symbol and proof that they've grown past the mistakes they made earlier. 2) If the gesture is made by the love interest, it should give the protagonist information they can apply to their own Crisis Decision. 3) Watch <em>Stranger Than Fiction</em>. Seriously, it's so good.</p>
