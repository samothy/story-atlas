          <p>Every culture in the world independently decided to recount fake events to each other, and Story Atlas is an attempt to understand why. At the time of writing, Netflix streams about 6 billion hours of content a month. As many as one million books were published traditionally last year in the U.S. alone, not to mention those that were self-published online. We tell stories to each other and to ourselves all day and then proceed to dream all night. Our lives are saturated with story.</p>
          
          <p>Despite the severity of our addiction, we still discern between good and bad stories. People walk out of theaters and hurl books against walls (or worse, politely stop reading with no emotional response at all). What makes the difference between a blockbuster and a bust? There are a lot of factors, and most of them don't interest me whatsoever&mdash;production value, individual tastes, and so on. But there are traits that many good stories have in common, ones that a writer of any means and skill level can put to use, and those are the things Story Atlas aims to explore.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote mx-5">
              <p>You can't learn how to write novels; you can only learn how to write the novel you're currently writing.</p>

          <p>Story Atlas is not an instruction manual. It's a catalogue of principles and techniques that worked for storytellers both ancient and modern; a toolbox, if you will, from which you might borrow certain tools as needed. Much as you don't use every word in your vocabulary in every conversation, it would be silly to try and use every tool in every story. Knowing which tools are available to you and how to use them, however, just might make the difference when the blank page looms and threads refuse to be tied.</p>

          <p>My name is Sam Frost, and I'm a self-taught web designer with a passion for stories&mdash;not necessarily in that order.</p>

          <p>I'm a lifelong storyteller, if not a celebrated one. All I can offer in the way of credentials is that one of my creepypastas was read on <a href='https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/episodes/s2/2x07' target='_blank'>the NoSleep Podcast</a> and a high school satire assignment was so successful it earned me a detention. That said, I've been writing original stories since I was old enough to reach the keyboard from my dad's office chair and I'm still doing it today. In the right hands, fabricated people can feel more real and more human than our closest friends and family, and that fact has confounded and fascinated me since childhood.</p>

          <p>This fascination has led me to spend the last year studying the nuts and bolts of storytelling, consolidating the best and most applicable advice from the masters of page and screen: Robert McKee, Anne Lamott, Stephen King, John Truby, Blake Snyder, and many others.</p>
