          <h2 class="mt-5">Author's Promises</h2>

          <hr class="mb-5">

          <p>Something magic happens when a reader picks up a book. Across time and space, two people reach out their hands to begin a negotiation.</p>
          
          <p>The reader pays money, presumably, but that's only a small part of what they bring to the table. They offer their time and powers of attention, both of which are finite and demanded elsewhere. They offer their trust and emotional vulnerability. And, unbeknownst to themselves, they promise to contribute significant amounts of imaginative labor themselves.</p>

          <p>As the author, your end of the bargain appears simple: to accept the audience's gifts and and make sure they don't regret it. When your blender doesn't work, you just return it and get your money back. But when a story doesn't work, the audience doesn't return the book. They feel personally cheated. They already devoted time and vulnerability, and those things can't be refunded. You, the author, weren't <em>honest</em>.</p>

          <p>Why do you want to write? There are a lot of respectable answers. To become rich and famous, to place your brick atop the cultural edifice, to be recognized as an artist. Here's the thing: none of those outcomes are the purpose of storytelling. There's nothing wrong with wanting money, fame, or recognition for your work, and don't let anybody tell you that expecting them is immoral. You do good work, and anything worth having is worth paying for. But these can only come as a result of doing your one job: to provide a meaningful experience for the audience.</p>

          <p>Life is full of coincidences and changes in fortune that have no deeper meaning whatsoever. Poetic justice is a human invention. Hard work isn't always met with recognition, kindness isn't always met with gratitude, and the worst people in the world will be more successful than you. Conversely, sometimes happiness is dropped in our laps that we don't deserve. Story-worlds are not like ours. Horrible things still happen in them, <em>must</em> happen&mdash;even senseless ones. At the end, however, the suffering means something and the rewards are earned. The good guys might not win, but the audience still leaves feeling stirred emotionally.</p>
          
          <p>Pouring yourself into a manuscript that nobody but you will ever read is good for you. The act of writing itself ought to be enjoyable and nourishing. But, on the off chance that you do want somebody else to acknowledge your work, the monologue must become a conversation. Don't imagine you're doing a magnanimous favor to the reader or that they ought to just sit back and admire your art. Storytelling is and always has been a collaborative affair. You're the guide, but if the audience lets go of your hand for any reason you'll arrive at the end of your story alone.</p>

          <p>The back-and-forth relationship between setup and payoff is the purest version of the author's promise. During the setup, the author says "Make a note of this, it'll be important later." At the payoff, the audience says, "Aha! I see what you did there." Both parts of this equation are essential; a setup without a payoff is misleading, and a payoff that hasn't been set up is a nonsequitur.</p>

          <h4 class="my-5">1. Chekhov's Gun</h4>

              <p>One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep.</p>

            <figcaption class="blockquote-footer text-end">

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The concept of Chekhov's Gun warns us that the audience is fluent in story-language. They know that certain symbols are meant to catch their attention and that they should brace themselves accordingly.</p>

          <p>Chekhov doesn't mean to say that every object you mention must play a major role later. Rather, we must be conscientious about the connotations that symbols carry and what their presence might foreshadow by accident. The gun is an ideal example because it can't be portrayed neutrally. As soon as a firearm appears on the screen or the page, the audience says <em>Holy shit, that's a gun!</em> The ordinary mailbox in Chapter 1 doesn't need <a href='https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/puns_walter-redfern_walter-d-redfern/720889/item/12604294/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9uKIBhA8EiwAYPUS3C3OqmBDVXt59Sfu86cxjAM5_PBR3xLkLhtTYDatm8ksQ3iycxiQLhoCeC8QAvD_BwE#idiq=12604294&edition=2445650' target='_blank'>to be addressed</a> in Chapter 10 because mailboxes are a weak symbol with little power to exert over the course of events. If that mailbox is inexplicably crawling with centipedes, on the other hand, it should probably mean something. The more you draw the reader's attention to something, the more crucial a role they'll expect it to play.</p>

          <p>In his book <em>The World Beyond Your Head</em>, Matthew B. Crawford explains that we don't see the world objectively as it appears in photographs. We perceive in terms of <em>affordances</em>, elements of the environment that we deem to be helpful or harmful. Anything that doesn't pertain to our survival in some way blends into the background and won't be stored in memory. You might remember the make and model of the car that cut you off, but you couldn't name a single detail about the hundreds of other cars you saw on the same trip. As storytellers we have the power to narrow a wide world of unimportant and conflicting information into a concentrated beam of meaning. Like the Olympic sport of curling, you can scrub out the irrelevant parts of life in order to clear the way for your punchlines.</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-5">

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">I mixed metaphors for this?</em></figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>This goes for characters, too. Beware making your minor characters too multifaceted and interesting. Any character that receives the audience's undivided attention, even for the duration of one line, will be remembered. Being memorable is good for the friend that will reappear to motivate the hero when all seems lost, bad for the shopkeeper that never appears again. The grammar of story language dictates that authors don't spend time crafting vibrant characters just so they can appear once. Falsely inflating a disposable character just to add color to one scene will backfire when the audience spends the remainder of the story waiting in vain for them to show up again. If a character you thought was disposable refuses to be confined to their role, perhaps they're due for a promotion.</p>

          <p>You can reverse engineer Chekhov's Gun to your advantage, especially if you're the type of writer who makes it up as they go. Ron Carlson likes to be intentionally overspecific in his first draft in order to give himself an inventory of details to pull from later. If you get stuck, look back at previous scenes and think like a reader, making a note of which details they would tuck away in their minds. Your taste and your instinct, never to be underestimated, may have provided you a gift during the first draft.</p>

          <h4 class="my-5">1.2 Obligatory Scenes</h4>

          <p>When we see Darth Vader board Leia's ship in the opening scene of <em>Star Wars</em>, we know through blatant and thorough coding that he's the bad guy. Conversely, Luke is immediately understood to be the homespun, down-to-earth protagonist. At this early stage we don't know when, where, how, or even why, but we sense with our gut that Luke and Vader must meet. A lifetime of consuming stories has taught us that they rarely deal in coincidences. If you can think of a satisfying climax to a version of the <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy in which Luke and Vader never cross paths, email me.</p>

          <p>George Lucas' decision to stylize these characters according to well-known archetypes is itself a form of foreshadowing. If, for whatever reason, the story could not allow a meeting between Luke and Vader, then Lucas would have coded them differently. By delineating the hero and villain, he allows us to anticipate&mdash;but not predict&mdash;the ending. Prompting the audience to reach forward in time like this actually heightens the tension because we've seen what Vader is capable of. Luke is just a farm boy. We <em>want</em> to see what takes place between now and the Obligatory Scene.</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-5">
            <img src="/assets/clumsy-luke.jpg" class="figure-img med-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Luke stabs himself in the eye with a lightsaber.">
          </figure>

          <p>The <strong>inciting incident</strong> is the trigger in the story that draws the protagonist into the unstoppable chain of events that ultimately leads to the climax. Consider the inciting incident as the setup to the Obligatory Scene's payoff. A story that begins with the protagonist falling hopelessly in love implies a climax that will decide whether the couple gets together or not. If the two confess their everlasting devotion on page 15, however, the audience reshuffles their expectations. Now they'll be waiting for the real inciting incident, something that introduces a new threat to the couple's relationship. Or maybe, as in the case of Pixar's <em>Up,</em> the inciting incident is totally unrelated and doesn't cast doubts the love story of Act I whatsoever. In that case, like <em>Up</em>, you'll need to mix in foreshadowing with the other stuff.</p>

          <p>"Obligatory" doesn't mean that the Council of Storytellers will kick down your door if you fail to include the scene. It becomes obligatory only as a result of the promises you make. Think of it less like a restriction and more like alley-ooping to yourself. After you throw the ball into the air there's only one thing left to do. You know it, the audience knows it, and they can't freakin' <em>wait.</em></p>

          <p>When you're writing a mystery, or any story where you have an earth-shattering revelation in your pocket, it feels like you're constantly in danger of spoiling it. How do you reveal enough to prepare the audience without saying too much and ruining the payoff?</p>

          <p>This kind of thinking assumes two things, neither of which are necessarily true. Firstly it takes for granted that the audience doesn't want to know what's coming and that the impact of twists comes from the element of total surprise. We'll talk more about this in the Story Shapes section, but suffice it to say that going out of your way to blind the audience will only make them feel betrayed.</p>

          <p>The second assumption is that the audience would even be able to piece your twist together in the first place. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency' target='_blank'>The Transparency Illusion</a> is the name for a tendency people have to overestimate how much other people know about what's happening inside their own heads. Brilliant writer and futurist Eliezer Yudkowski <a href="https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries" target='_blank'>wrote this essay</a> about his experience with the Transparency Illusion while writing <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>. Yudkowski watched, chagrined, as his most obvious clues were passed between fans as fringe theories and the well-hidden ones went unnoticed altogether.</p>

          <p>This isn't because readers are stupid. The twists in your story seem painfully obvious to you because you contain the entire story in your brain. The cause and effect exist simultaneously, tethered both forward and backward in time. The audience experiences your story in forward linear time, and even then only through the words you give them.</p>

          <p>There's no need to deliberately conceal answers from the reader. Yudkowski goes on to say that, if anything, you'll need to go out of your way make them aware there's a question to begin with. It's hard enough to shape the audience's expectations when you <em>want</em> to be obvious, let alone give away a mystery. Cover your tracks only if test audiences are consistently able to unravel your twists too early in the story.</p>

          <p>That said...</p>

          <p>We've talked in previous essays about the deficiencies of language, specifically when it comes to conveying complex feelings. Human experience is a rich spectrum. Even a language like English, by some estimates containing over a million words, could not possibly give a name to every shade of every emotion.</p>

          <p>If you tell me that Jenny is sad, I learn very little about her. Is she habitually sad, or just sad right now? Is she sad because she just dropped her iced coffee, or because she did the math and discovered that, if current trends continue, <a href='https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html'>she'll only visit her parents about 15 more times before they die</a>? These scenarios are both "sad," but not remotely comparable.</p>

          <p>The good news is that we don't <em>need</em> words to know how somebody is feeling. Humans have the uncanny ability to put on somebody else's shoes and extrapolate how they themselves would feel in the same situation. This is called empathy, and for the reader it's not a chore but the reason they came in the first place. When you hear the tired adage, "Show, don't tell," take this to mean that you should seize any opportunity to take the audience's empathy for a walk. </p>

          <p>Don't tell us Jenny feels sad. Don't "show" her wiping away tears, either, unless she's in a situation that doesn't normally warrant crying. We're already familiar with the things that make <em>everyone</em> sad, and we know what <em>everyone</em> does when they're sad. What makes your character sad, and how does that sadness affect their behavior? Show Jenny holding the box of stuff from her desk as she makes the rounds, exchanging perfectly mundane words with each of her coworkers&mdash;<em>former</em> coworkers. But the words don't stop. The group keeps chatting and pouring coffee until all the other employees have clocked out, until the sun sets, until the custodians push vacuums and finally lock up behind them. The audience infers, through no conscious effort of their own, what none of the characters dare to say out loud: when Jenny leaves the building, she can never come back.</p>

          <p>Spelling out what your text means to say doesn't just hobble the reader. It also deprives <em>you</em> of the opportunity to describe some part of the human experience in a way that's never been done before. You commit the sin of cliche when you rely on words that belong to everybody in order to express something that should belong only to you. The various lenses through which you view the world create a perspective that's utterly unique, and I guarantee you won't find anything in the dictionary that can do it justice.</p>

          <p>If your characters have real agendas and behave in ways that real people do (or at least in ways the audience can <em>believe</em> people would behave), then the reader unthinkingly generates a simulation and steps inside of it. As Ron Carlson says, the goal isn't complete accuracy to life but a feasible representation of it. Don't waste time trying to force realism where it doesn't belong; if you can represent people and their experiences with enough honesty, the audience will follow you wherever you go.</p>

          <p>A well-told story can, for a few precious moments, lower a person's intellectual defenses. We approach most information with a healthy skepticism, but don't often feel the need to do so when reading a book or watching TV&mdash;after all, stories are all made up. Stripped of its cynicism like this, a mind is suggestible, and a mainstream story might coax millions of people into this vulnerable state. This is an unfathomable amount of leverage for creators to hold&mdash;and power, in any form, can be abused. Once the Trojan horse is inside the walls, it's not always good guys that come clambering out.</p>

          <p>The Netflix original show <em>13 Reasons Why</em> is an infamous example of the influence that stories can have on the real world. In the wake of Hannah Baker's fictional suicide, the rate of real suicides in boys between the ages of 10 and 17 spiked by almost 30%. The show's creators violated the contract between themselves and the audience by failing to consider what they were saying and to whom. Hello Future Me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c8o68ghGBM" target='_blank'>made a video essay</a> recently regarding the perils of representing mental illness in media. Avoiding the topic because it's uncomfortable serves to further isolate those who suffer, but careless representation can push someone in the wrong direction.</p>

          <p>I believe that the mistakes of <em>13 Reasons Why</em> were at least committed in good faith. While dangerously irresponsible, Netflix and developer Brian Yorkey didn't intend for their portrayal of suicide to be emulated by the audience. D.W. Griffith, on the other hand, certainly knew what he was doing when he directed <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, the 1915 film that revived the defunct Ku Klux Klan.</p>

          <figure class="figure text-center m-5">
            <img src="/assets/birth-of-a-nation.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A poster for the original Birth of a Nation film.">
          </figure>
          
          <p>Are all the hate crimes of the 20th century attributable to D.W. Griffith? No, of course not. Racism in the United States is never far beneath the surface&mdash;if it wasn't <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, some other flashpoint would have summoned the white nationalists from their restless dormancy. But the fact remains that Griffith did tell that story, and the new wave of Klansmen adopted his imagery as they expanded their influence further than ever. The First Klan boasted 550,000 members at its height. The Second recruited as many as six million. Free speech doesn't protect the man who yells "Fire!" in a crowded theater, but it does protect the author who yells "Fire!" in a crowded country.</p>

          <p>All this may come off as melodramatic, especially for somebody who wants to write, say, paranormal romance fan-fiction. Believe me, I also didn't think I would be writing about the Ku Klux Klan when I first began Story Atlas. But it turns out that even paranormal romance fan-fiction <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2015/02/consent-isnt-enough-in-fifty-shades-of-grey/385267/" target='_blank'>can have a negative social impact.</a> The power of story can be used for good, and most authors and screenwriters manage to do so. Art speaks the unspeakable, describes the indescribable, comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable. Be mindful of which social crawlspaces you shine your flashlight into, because you may vindicate ideologies or normalize taboos that ought to be left in the dark.</p>

          <p>This is also complicated by the fact that once you release your story into the world, you relinquish any control over how it's interpreted. Stories that are meant to condemn certain social practices might romanticize them by mistake&mdash;think <em>Goodfellas</em> or <em>Fight Club</em>.</p>
