          <p>Those who engage in creative work are allergic to rules, and rightfully so. There's virtually nothing you can say about art that's mandatory, irrefutable, or universal. Besides, good writing is supposed to come from some divine source, primal and unsullied by the conscious mind. What could be more toxic to art than a <em>formula?</em></p> 
          
          <p>Much in the way that even the most expert ornithologist can't tell a bird what to be, all we can do is look through the binoculars and see what stories do in their natural habitat. Conventions aren't rules but principles&mdash;observable story traits that are only important to the extent that they're useful for self-expression.</p>

          <p>Story Atlas is not an instruction manual, but a toolbox. Artists retain the right to discard any advice they don't like and assimilate that which serves them. I believe that knowing the conventions of storytelling <em>will</em> serve you&mdash;even if you think your story isn't conventional.</p>

            What's a Trope?
          </h3>

          <p>You may be asking yourself why anyone would want to write a "conventional" story anyway. The world is already full of derivative and predictable content. Your story, on the other hand, has never been told before. You're going to add something to the conversation, dammit!</p>

          <p>I'm not being defeatist when I say that some version of your story <em>has</em> been told before. Okay, take a deep breath. This is not the end of the world, and it's certainly no reason to stop telling stories. Most importantly, resisting this fact will only harm you and your ability to express yourself.</p>

          <p>A trope is kind of a mid-size building block you can use to put together a story. They're like the words of story-language&mdash;by combining various tropes, you can create a sentence that will put an idea from your head into the audience's head. Both you and the audience have spent your lives learning tropes from the media you consume, which makes them invaluable tools for reaching into the audience's brain.</p>

          <p>Tropes exist on all levels of scale. For instance, you can decide to stage <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper" target='_blank'>a heist</a>, but the victim is <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList" target="_blank">a fantasy Dark Lord</a>&mdash;inadvertently becoming the heroes by depriving the villain of their <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. That's already a pretty decent idea (a version of which I think Brandon Sanderson wrote). Heist movies come with a crew of specialists; how will you <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterIntroductionIndex" target="_blank">introduce those characters?</a> I bet there's a chase scene, but <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene" target="_blank">what kind?</a> The amount of combinations that exist based on only those few choices is already staggering, and any two storytellers would come up with vastly different results.</p>

          <p>If you're thinking that you want to be completely original and defy all tropes, I have bad news. A completely tropeless story would be:</p>

          <ol class='my-4'>
            <li class='p-2'>Well, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TheTropelessTale">impossible</a>. Every property has its corollary, and every trope has a documented version, subversion, inversion, and combination. A storyteller can invent a new story element as easily as a painter can invent a new color.</li>
            <li class='p-2'>Not artistic. Much like trying to find a chord progression that's never been attempted in music, you <em>might</em> succeed if you're stubborn enough, but to what end? Is this really what drove you to write in the first place?</li>
            <li class='p-2'>Unproductive. Grammar isn't a fascist device invented to limit the things you can say. The speaker and listener agree on certain symbols and how to combine them because otherwise there's no way to guarantee your intent will be understood. Story-grammar allows you to be <em>more</em> expressive by opening a two-way connection with the audience.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Execution is everything. If you put any two stories side-by-side, you can pare them down until they're the same. <em>Dances With Wolves</em> has more in common with <em>Avatar</em> than <em>Gone Girl</em> does with <em>Oliver Twist</em>, but all four have a common ancestor <em>somewhere</em> down the line. It's the millions of minuscule choices that set stories apart, from major plot developments all the way down to the sentence-level language.</p>

          <p>I'm not telling a bird what it ought to be, here. We can all see the bird and we agree that it has two wings and a beak. Even the rarest and most beautiful bird is still recognizable as a bird. If it didn't have wings and a beak we would call it something else&mdash;a feather-lump, perhaps. And you know a feather-lump when you see it, because when you were expecting a bird and get a feather-lump instead, you feel cheated.</p>

          <p>That metaphor got out of hand, which is unfortunate because it was worth two metaphors in the bush. My point is that conventions don't come from some authoritarian body that aims to suppress your art. They come from the art itself.</p>

            The Story State
          </h3>

          <p>I hope I'm not ruining anyone's day when I say that space wizards never dueled with laser swords on an artifical moon. It's also kind of weird that alien races can speak their own languages at each other and be mutually understood. Perhaps there's a certain individual in your life who takes any opportunity to explain that pyrotechnical explosions are impossible in space. But we let all that slide because we didn't show up for a story about language barriers or the logistics of warfare in a vacuum. You could remake <em>Star Wars</em> in a way that was scientifically plausible from the bottom up, but it wouldn't be a better story as a result.</p>

          <p>The word "suspension" in the term <em>suspension of disbelief</em> implies that disbelieving is our natural state and that we have to quash it in order to enjoy fiction. On the contrary, cynicism is a skill that we only develop around the same time we start being rude to our parents for sport. Children view the world with indiscriminate innocence and curiosity, giving any information the opportunity to be true.</p>
          
          <p>Good storytelling allows us to be children for a little while. The words "Once upon a time" act as an incantation that lifts the burden of scrutiny from our shoulders. As long as the spell is sustained, anything can be accepted as true&mdash;sort of.</p>

          <p>Your Brain On Story has no problem accepting things that aren't true, like pyrotechnics in space. But alarms go off when it encounters something that isn't honest, like the success of Anakin's flirting in the prequels.</p>
          
          <p>The distinction between truth and honesty is really more of an author's promise than anything, but that essay was already too long to introduce such an important topic. In story-worlds, almost anything can be true as long as you tell it honestly. Don't worry&mdash;this concept is confusing for everybody and we'll discuss it a lot. Are you getting sick of hearing that yet?</p>

          <p>The core skill of storytelling is convincing the audience that they're not being told a story at all&mdash;the story state. All the most common writing advice about dialogue, exposition, setting description, characterization (and so on) basically comes down to how you can sustain the story state.</p>
